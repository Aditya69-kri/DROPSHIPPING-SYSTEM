# DROPSHIPPING-SYSTEM
Dropshipping system is an aid which helps you to find your total profit in dropshipping.

What is Dropshipping?
Dropshipping is a form of retail business wherein the seller accepts customer orders but does not keep goods sold in stock, Instead, in a form of supply chain management, the seller transfers orders and their shipment details to the manufacturer, a wholesaler, another retailer, or a fulfillment house, which then ships goods directly to the customer. The seller makes a profit on the difference between the item’s wholesale and retail price.

Working of the project
The Dropshipping record system is created using the codes and functions from the programming language C. For this project we use file handling and the program is built using the following files:
•	customer
•	supplier
•	product
•	finance

The files contain the following information:
•	customer: name, phone, address, product, quantity, date, and order number
•	supplier: product, name, phone, and address
•	product: name, weight, order number
•	finance: order number, product, initial price, final price, and profit made
We also use functions in the program.
The program starts with a menu being displayed and performs tasks according to the choices selected by the user.
After the task is performed, the program will again ask the user to choose from the menu, the user may continue to use the program or exit it.
